# Design-of-Autonomous-Mobile-Robot
A Funded Project by La Foundation - Dassault Systems which involves the design of an Autonomous Mobile Robot using LiDAR.

## Analyzing the Need
Autonomous mobile robots are becoming more prominent in recent time because of their relevance and applications to the world today. Their ability to navigate in an environment without a need for physical or electro-mechanical guidance devices has made it more promising and useful.The use of autonomous mobile robots is emerging in different sectors such as companies, industries, hospital, institutions, agriculture, and homes to improve services and daily activities. Due to technology advancement, the demand for mobile robot has increased due to the task they perform and services they render such as carrying heavy objects, monitoring, search and rescue missions, etc. Various studies have been carried out by researchers on the importance of mobile robot, its applications and challenges.The study, therefore, gives good direction for further developments of designs of autonomous mobile robots.

## Problem Statement
Design and Development of an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR), for an Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS), which can carry a minimum payload of 3kg, and lift the payload to a height of 210 mm at a velocity of 0.5 m/s with a runtime of 1 hour.
